Here’s a **summarized study note** for the AWS Cloud Technical Essentials topics you mentioned:

---

## **AWS Cloud Technical Essentials – Summary Notes**

### **1. Monitoring on AWS**

* **Amazon CloudWatch**

  * Collects and tracks metrics (CPU, memory, network, logs, custom metrics).
  * Dashboards to visualize performance.
  * Alarms to trigger actions (ex: scale EC2, send notifications via SNS).
  * Logs Insights for querying application/system logs.
  * Integration with other AWS services (e.g., Lambda, Auto Scaling).

* **AWS CloudTrail**

  * Records API calls and user activity for auditing and compliance.
  * Helps track “who did what, when, and from where.”

---

### **2. Optimizing Solutions on AWS**

* **Right-sizing resources**: Match instance/storage type to workload.
* **Elasticity**: Scale in/out with demand (Auto Scaling + Load Balancing).
* **Storage tiers**: Use S3 storage classes (Standard, IA, Glacier) based on access needs.
* **Cost optimization tools**:

  * **Trusted Advisor**: Recommendations on cost, performance, security.
  * **Cost Explorer / AWS Budgets**: Track and manage spend.

---

### **3. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**

* **Purpose**: Automatically adjust EC2 instances based on traffic or performance.
* **Scaling types**:

  * *Dynamic scaling*: Responds to metrics (CPU, requests).
  * *Predictive scaling*: Uses ML to forecast demand.
* **Key concepts**:

  * *Launch template*: Defines instance configuration.
  * *Scaling policies*: Define when/how to scale.
  * *Health checks*: Replace unhealthy instances.

---

### **4. Route Traffic with Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**

* **Distributes traffic** across multiple targets (EC2, containers, Lambda).
* **Types**:

  * *Application Load Balancer (ALB)* → HTTP/HTTPS (Layer 7).
  * *Network Load Balancer (NLB)* → High performance TCP/UDP (Layer 4).
  * *Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)* → Deploy/manage third-party appliances.
* **Benefits**: Fault tolerance, better availability, SSL termination, sticky sessions.

---

### **5. Amazon Q Developer (Security Scanning)**

* **Amazon Q Developer** → AI-powered assistant for coding, debugging, and security checks.
* **Security scanning**:

  * Identifies vulnerabilities in code and infrastructure.
  * Provides remediation suggestions.
  * Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for proactive checks.
* **Compliance support**: Helps align with standards (SOC 2, ISO, HIPAA, etc.).

---

✅ **Quick Takeaway**:

* **Monitor** resources with CloudWatch + CloudTrail.
* **Optimize** by right-sizing, using cost tools, and scaling effectively.
* **Scale** workloads automatically with EC2 Auto Scaling.
* **Balance** incoming traffic using ELB for high availability.
* **Secure & Scan** apps with Amazon Q Developer AI assistant.
